**TankTrix is a 3D shooter developed in Unity3D using the C# programming langues ofr one of my first year modules.** The main objective of the game is to get the highest score by killing enemy tanks. There are multiple types of enemies with different stats such as shooting speed and movement speed.
The main attraction of the game are its minimalistic graphics which are not 3d modelled but rather coded in C# by me. Here are some renderings of them. The renderings are simple ingame screenshots of the models:

**The code used to achieve this models can be found inside this repository at `TankTrix\Scripts\TankModel.cs` and `TankTrix\Scripts\TreeModel.cs`.**

# Download the game/project

All you have to do is `git clone https://github.com/tymscar/TankTrix`

# Play the game

One of the main attractions of the game is that it can be easily compiled for any platform of choice thanks to Unity3D.
I already preconfigured the controls to work with most controllers out there so it is easy to get going after downloading the game.
If you play on Windows all you need to do is run the `TankTrix\Game\Tanktrix.exe` file.
If you are not on windows and you want to give it a go, just open up the Unity project found in `TankTrix\Unity5 Project` and compile for your platform of choice.

# Controls

For keyboard/mouse: `WASD` to move, `mouse` to look around and `Left click` to shoot. If you want to restart the game, press `R`
For controller users: `Left stick` to move, `Right stick` to look around, `lower most button on the right side of the controller` to shoot and `right most button` to restart.
The controls can be changed inside the Unity project.

# Changing the game

To look through the Unity3D project, we have also included all the file neccesary as well as the assets and scenes. All copyrights belong to their respective owners.

# Technical Details

The game is made in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) using the [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) game engine.
The player models and any other graphical assets are made in code at runetime (code is available at `TankTrix\Scripts\TankModel.cs` and `TankTrix\Scripts\TreeModel.cs`).
